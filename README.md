 An example Flutter application to showcase navigation concepts in Flutter


## How to run?

Firstly, you have to have Flutter installed. Flutter can be installed through Flutter's official platform: [Install | Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gclid=CjwKCAjwp7eUBhBeEiwAZbHwkQy5-a43EsgM6SboS6GWyD1tOVQnn4KL-TLVmn5IZiV60RGrGdQI1RoConoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

Now, that you have installed Flutter and ran `flutter doctor`, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK

- Android Studio
  
  - Be sure to accept all licenses before proceeding

- A phone emulator (Can be created via Android Studio if not already by following this tutorial: [Create & Manage AVDs](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds))

Now that you're ready to run Flutter apps, clone this repo, and open its contents in Android Studio.

Start your emulator, then run the project from main.dart

**Note:** Please make sure you have the Flutter plugin in Android Studio, and that the project is running as a Flutter project, not a dart file. 



## Project Lessons

This project is supposed to showcase the following concepts in Flutter:

* Using GridView

* Screens, pages, etc are all widgets

* Registering a widget as a home/initial screen

* Using named and unnamed routes

* Navigation for named and unnamed routes

* Building a ***BottomNavigationBar***

* Building and using a ***Drawer*** for more navigation options

* Replacing pages instead of pushing/popping can help avoid an unnecessarily big navigation stack
